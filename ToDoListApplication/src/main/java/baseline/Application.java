        have much of  a design done right now,
        but I was in a lot of pain earlier this week
        because what I thought was a tailbone injury turned out be a cist
        which I didn't figure out until yesterday.
        So I tried my best to get this much done today,
        I did attend lectures online, I only made the last
        30 minutes of yesterday's lecture since that was
        the time I got back home from the hospital, and I
        hope now I can get more on tracks since I was initially
        really excited to mess around with GUIs.
        Thanks for reading if you saw this.
